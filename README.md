#Slides

The source for the slides as well as the slides themselves are located here.

#Building the Slides

The built slides are already included, but if you wish to build the slides anyway, you must install landslide. Instructions for installing landslide can be found here:
https://github.com/adamzap/landslide

After landslide is installed successfully, you may build the slides by running `make` from a terminal. If that doesn't work you can also do:

`landslide slides.md -d slides.html`
