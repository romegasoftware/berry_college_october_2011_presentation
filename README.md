#SAI Digital October 4, 2011 Presentation at Berry College


##Slides

The source for the slides are here. You may view the slides [here](http://saidigital.github.com/berry_college_october_2011_presentation/slides.html)

##Building the Slides

The built slides are already included, but if you wish to build the slides anyway, you must install landslide. Detailed, instructions for installing landslide can be found here:

https://github.com/adamzap/landslide

However, if you *know* you have `pip` installed you can install landslide by running:

`pip install landslide`

After landslide is installed successfully, you may build the slides by running `make` from a terminal in the `src` directory. If that doesn't work you can also do:

`landslide config.cfg`
