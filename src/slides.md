Projects
========

A project lifecycle looks something like this:

-  Client makes request.
-  Meet with client. Gather requirements for application.
-  Give and release quote.
-  Build.
-  Deploy.


---

Projects - Client makes request
===============================

Our clients fill out a "ClientDiscovery" form which details what the client needs.

---

Projects - Meet with client
===========================

A meeting is scheduled with the client. We discuss the ClientDiscovery form and
"flesh out" the product from what the client needs.

---

Projects - Give and release quote
=================================

Based on the notes from the meeting and the ClientDiscovery form, a quote is given.

The features based from our meeting and the ClientDiscovery form are itemized.

Usually, what the client asks for is similar to something we have done in the past, and we base our hourly estimates off of that.

---

Projects - Build
================

After the quote is released, the designers build mockups. The mockups are then approved by the client.

After a mockup is approved, the developers construct a template from the mockups.

Features requiring development work are implemented.

After most features are complete, the product is demoed for the client.

---

Projects - Deploy
=================

After a project is finished and the client is satisfied, the project is deployed.

We generally deploy the product on a RackSpace cloud host.
